# What literature has the best Scrabble words?

I started making an interpreter for [Beatnik](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Beatnik) but got sidetracked doing this.

# Scrabble score distribution

I plotted the percentage of words with each scrabble score for the following public domain documents:
* Works of Shakespeare
* King James Bible
* Dickens - A Christmas Carol
* Darwin - Origin of Species
* Grimms' fairy tales

It seems for a sufficiently large/varied text, it will follow quite a similar pattern.
